<h3>Rich real-time traffic data is being obtained using advanced sensors such as Video and GPS as well as communication technologies at a data centre in the Intelligent Transportation Systems laboratory. This data offers tremendous scope to investigate empirical patterns and use these insights to operate and manage the transportation system towards desired objectives including reduced congestion, improved reliability and safety, better fuel efficiency and decrease in environmental pollution. The focus of this work will be to mine this data to derive empirical understanding and develop models towards this broad goal. Specific focus areas include quantification of the ITS data to investigate the role of various sources that affect system performance (demand, incidents, weather, construction, special events, control devices etc.) and applying this knowledge towards the development of algorithms for optimizing and improving system performance.<h3>
