We are an interdisciplinary group dedicated to pioneering innovative approaches and algorithms that integrate multi-dimensional data across scales to understand, predict and manipulate complex biological systems.

The key research activities in the IBSE are â€“ (i) Biological network analysis, which includes the prediction of molecular function in cells and populations, and environmental and evolution-dependent modulation of networks; (ii) Development of algorithms using machine learning, graph mining, linear programming, to study protein folding pathways, predict protein function, define novel metabolic pathways and understand pathogenesis by disease-causing mutations.
