<h3>
	Traffic congestion is one of the major challenges faced by traffic engineers all over the world. Solutions ranging from major infrastructure development to smaller traffic management measures such as reversible lanes and one way roads are being tried out to address this problem. One such solution to alleviate congestion, with minimal infrastructure, is to manage the traffic in real time using advanced technologies and methodologies. Such solutions are part of the general area of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). These solutions are required to be developed as an integral part of the smart city initiatives by the Government of India.
