	Learning deep representations from raw input data has revolutionized the field of Machine Learning in the past few years. While deep representation learning has been extremely successful in computer vision and natural language processing, there have been very few studies involving representation learning on network data (for example, social network data). For many problems in social network analysis, bioinformatics, knowledge representation, etc., one encounters relational data where the properties (features, labels, etc.) of different data-points are correlated. For example, people connected to each other have a higher chance of belonging to the same community, or of having a similar opinion. Intuitively, for such problems, representation learning algorithms which incorporate the relational information as a network are expected to perform better than traditional IID-based machine learning algorithms which treat each data point independently. In this project, we propose to build a theory of network representation learning along the lines of language modelling for textual data.
