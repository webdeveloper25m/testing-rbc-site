	Statistical experimentation, or Design of Experiments in conventional usage, is the science of conducting tests on systems to understand and improve them. It involves making systematic and purposeful changes to factors (input variables) and observing their effects on the response (output variable). Traditional statistical experimentation has focused on model building in offline settings. However, there are a multitude of real-world systems that cannot be taken offline, partly or wholly. Also, in many cases the motivation to experiment could by process improvement rather than gaining knowledge of the system through mathematical models. The machine learning field of reinforcement learning, deals with similar problems through the multi-armed bandit settings and their extensions.This research seeks to apply the concepts from bandit problems to designed experiments, which focus primarily on multiple input variables, and specifically the experiments ability to exploit the interactive effects that might exist between the input variables. Concepts from Active learning, Stochastic optimization and game theory will also be leveraged in order to create effective algorithms.
