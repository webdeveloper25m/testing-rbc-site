<h3>
	In the domain of systems biology, the centre functions closely with the Initiative for Biological Systems Engineering (IBSE). We work primarily on cancer genomics and biological network analytics. We also undertake collaborative research with medical research foundations on analysing patient data, often to enable semi-automated early screening systems.
