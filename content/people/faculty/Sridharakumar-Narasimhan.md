	<h2>Profile</h2>
	<h3>
		Dr. Sridharakumar Narasimhan received his M.Tech (Integrated course) degree in Chemical Engineering from IIT Bombay in 1998. Subsequently, he worked for 2 years as a process engineer in the mineral process group of the R&D division of Larsen and Toubro, Mumbai for 2 years. He then started his graduate studies in Chemical Engineering and obtained his PhD from Clarkson University in 2006. From 2006-2008 he was a post-Doctoral Scholar in the department of Chemical Engineering, NTNU, Trondheim, Norway. He joined the department of chemical engineering at IIT Madras in 2008. He has visited Texas Tech University, TU Delft and RWTH Aachen. His research interests are in process operations (control, fault diagnosis), system identification and optimization. One of the major goals of his research is to arrive at designs for control structures, water networks, sensor networks, heat exchanger networks, experiments with guaranteed performance specifications. A common thread in these problems is the application of convexity theory to arrive at tractable optimization problems. He is also interested in the application of systems theory in biology, medicine and infrastructure.
