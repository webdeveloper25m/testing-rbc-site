	<h2>Profile</h2>
	<h3>
		Dr. Sivaram Ambikasaran's broad area of reseach is in computational and applied mathematics with a strong focus on constructing highly accurate fast algorithms leveraging approximation theory and numerical linear algebra. To be specific, he works on fast low-rank factorizations, fast multipole method and direct solvers for structured matrices with application to elliptic PDEs, integral equations, quadratures, computational statistics, inverse problems, data assimilation, filtering and other related areas of computational science.
