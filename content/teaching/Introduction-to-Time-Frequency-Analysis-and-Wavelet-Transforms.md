<h3>The course introduces the basic concepts of time-frequency analysis such as joint energy density, duration-bandwidth principle, analytic signals, etc. and wavelet transforms, specifically, the continuous and discrete versions. A short review of Fourier transforms will be presented at the start of the course.<h3>
