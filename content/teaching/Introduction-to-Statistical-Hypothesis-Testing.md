<h3>Hypothesis testing is concerned with statistical testing of postulates (usually concerning parameters) in an empirical way, i.e., from data. It is an important subject and step in all spheres of data analysis. The course aims at providing the basics of hypothesis testing with emphasis on some commonly encountered hypothesis tests in statistical data analysis such as in comparisons of averages, testing for variability, proportions and significance testing in regression analysis.</h3>
